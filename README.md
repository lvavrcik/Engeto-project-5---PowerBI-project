# Power BI project #
## Project description ##
Within this project, I visualized cryptocurrency data in Power BI - cryptocurrency dashboard.

**Brief description**:

Aim of this project was to create a Power BI visualisation of some of the cryptocurrencies.
I used two datasets (described below) with information about closing prices, opening prices, high prices, low prices, market cap and others within years (2013 - 2021).
There are 23 cryptocurrencies in total in scope.
Based on the overview, it's easy to analyze its price development, patterns and anomalies.

Visualisation has:
- 4 pages
- 6 different visuals (charts, tables,...)
- filtering with slicers
- bookmarks/pages navigation
- 2 data sources
- data hierarchy
- 1 measure / 1 calculated column

**Dataset used**: 

I used the following datasets as data sources:  
    - `CryptoData.xlsx` [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)    
    - `Crypto.csv` [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bishop36/crypto-data)
